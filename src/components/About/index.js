        <p>My name is Colin Thompson, I am a full stack web developer with an affinity for front end design.</p>
        <p>My journey into tech began during the pandemic when my aunt asked me to update her companyâ€™s website despite me not having any experience in the field. With a combination of google and trial and error the website was brought from 2010 to 2021. This started a passion.</p>
        <p>In April of 2022 I left my established career in operations management to pursue a coding bootcamp and grow my understanding as a developer. At the bootcamp I fell in love with the agile development cycle, and tweeking projects along the way.</p>
        <p>I am currently looking for opportunites to grow in the field and learn new things!</p>
        <p>My email is colinthompson1996@gmail.com if you are looking to contact me!</p>
